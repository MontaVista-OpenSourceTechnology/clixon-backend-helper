# clixon backend helper

A clixon backend that provides helpful functions for a backend.  These are:
* Per-namespace plugins.  A plugin may be bound to specific namespaces
  and is only called for XML items that have the top-level namespaces.
  That way the plugin doesn't have to parse everything, it just gets what
  it needs.
* External program helpers.  Since clixon drops privileges after it starts,
  if you need to perform certain operation at privilege you need an external
  program to do this.  (Not yet implmented.)
* python plugins.

## Compile and run

Build and install clixon first, or install it from your distro if
available.  Then run:
```
    meson build
    meson compile -C build
    meson install -C build
```

This will install the .so in ${prefix}/libexec/clixon_beh.so.  It will
install a python `_clixon_beh.so` and `clixon_beh.py` file into the proper
place for python to pick it up.  And it will install `clixon_beh.h` in
the include directory.  It will install a `clixon-beh-config` yang file
into clixon's yang directory.  And that should be all you need.

## Examples

Each directory in the examples directory is a stand-alone build

## The C Interface

The C interface for clixon_beh is similar to the one for the clixon
proper.  The major differences are:
* The module init function is `clixon_beh_plugin_init()`.
* You must call `clixon_beh_add_plugin()` to register a plugin.  You don't
  return a pointer from the module init function.  You can register
  multiple plugins from the same module.
* You can pass a namespace to `clixon_beh_add_plugin()`.  You will only
  get called when those namespaces change at the top level, and only
  with the xml subtrees with thost namespaces (again, top-level).
  If you pass in `NULL` for the namespace, you get everything, just like
  the main clixon API.
* You get a plugin object when you add it.  This will be passed in to
  all your functions.  You can store a void * in it to keep data around.
* A transaction is passed around, and you can store a data item in it
  with `clixon_beh_trans_set_data()` and retrieve it with
  `clixon_beh_trans_get_data()`.  Make sure to free it in the end and
  abort functions!
* Currently the transaction only has the old and new trees, not the
  added, deleted, and changed trees.

### External Program Interface

Not yet implemented.

## The Python Interface

Python interface.
